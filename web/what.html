				<h4>What is NetBeans IDE?</h4>
                <p>The <a href='http://netbeans.org'>NetBeans IDE</a> is an open-source integrated development environment. NetBeans IDE supports development of all Java application types (Java SE including JavaFX, (Java ME, web, EJB and mobile applications) out of the box. Among other features are an Ant-based project system, Maven support, refactorings, version control.</p>
				
                <h4>What is Github?</h4>
                <p><a href='https://github.com'>GitHub</a> is a web-based hosting service for software development projects that use the Git revision control system. It is written using Ruby on Rails by GitHub, Inc. (previously known as Logical Awesome) developers Chris Wanstrath, PJ Hyett, and Tom Preston-Werner. GitHub offers both commercial plans and free accounts for open source projects. According to the Git User's Survey in 2009, GitHub is the most popular Git hosting site.</p>
                <p>The site provides social networking functionality such as feeds, followers and the network graph to display how developers work on their versions of a repository.</p>
				<p>GitHub also operates a pastebin-style site, wikis for the individual repositories and web pages that can be edited through a git repository.</p>               
				
                <h4>What is Peek into Github?</h4>
                <p>Peek into Github is a NetBeans IDE plugin which allows you to view a particular user's (usually your's) repositories and each repository's details.</p>
                
				<div class="titleblock">what's out there apart from Peek into Github?</div>
                <p>As per my research, there is no NetBeans IDE plugin which allows you to tie NetBeans IDE and Github together.</p>
				<p>However, if you happen to know about one, <a href='http://twitter.com/rishabhsrao'>send me a tweet</a>.</p>
